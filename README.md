## Challenge description

<p>
  The application is already fully functional but most of its code is directly in the App.tsx file. To solve this in the best way,
  it is necessary to divide the application into at least two main parts: sidebar and the main content that has the header and the movie listing.
</p>

  -   **The application has only one main feature, which is the movie listing;**
  -   **In the sidebar it is possible to select which category of movies should be listed;**
  -   **The first category in the list (which is "Action") should already start as checked;**
  -   **O header da aplica√ß√£o possui apenas o nome da categoria selecionada que deve mudar dinamicamente.**
